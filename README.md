# Unity Configuration System (UCS)

Unity Configuration System (UCS) is a robust utility designed to streamline configuration management in Unity projects. This tool provides an efficient solution for storing, loading, modifying, and accessing configurations from a text file, enabling easy customization and adaptation of the application to specific user or game needs.

Key Features:

· Versatile Storage: UCS uses a text file to store configurations, making it easy to manage and distribute.

· Easy Access: Developers can quickly and easily access configurations using identification keys.

· Dynamic Modification: UCS allows configurations to be modified at runtime, facilitating adjustments and adaptations during game development or execution.

· Unity Integration: Specifically designed for Unity projects, UCS seamlessly integrates into the developer's usual workflow.

· Flexible Customization: Developers can tailor UCS to the specific needs of their project by adding new functionalities or modifying existing behavior.

# Usage Examples:

  ```
// Save a new configuration
Configurator.SetConfig("MusicVolume", "0.5", true);

// Access an existing configuration
string musicVolume = Configurator.getConfig("MusicVolume");

// Modify a configuration
Configurator.SetConfig("SoundEffectsVolume", "0.8");

// Save changes to the configuration file
Configurator.SaveConfig();
 ```

# Modification and Customization:

UCS is designed with a modular and flexible approach, making it easy to modify and customize according to project needs. Developers can modify UCS behavior by adding new features, optimizing performance, or adapting it to specific project requirements.

# Integration with Existing Projects:

UCS seamlessly integrates into existing Unity projects. Developers can simply add the Configurator.cs file to their project and start using it immediately. Additionally, UCS is compatible with multiple target platforms, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices and operating systems.

# Contributions and Support:

UCS is an open-source project, meaning the developer community is welcome to contribute new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Developers can report issues or request additional features through the project's GitHub page.
